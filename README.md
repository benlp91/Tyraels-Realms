This is a Campaign for Keeper FX.
It needs the newest Alpha to work correctly.

To install you need to click the green "code" button and click and download zip.

sadly git hub is putting my stuff in a main folder which is not readable the game.
You open the main folder until you see my 6 Files , and all those 6 Files needs to go into KeeperFX/campgns
