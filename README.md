🏰 KeeperFX Custom Campaign

This is a custom campaign for KeeperFX.
Please note: It requires the latest Alpha version of KeeperFX to run correctly.

📦 Installation Instructions

1.Click the green “Code” button at the top of this page.

2.Select “Download ZIP” and extract the contents to a temporary folder.

Unfortunately, GitHub places all files into an extra folder, which KeeperFX cannot read directly.

3.Open that folder and locate the following 6 files:

Tyrales_realms
Tyraels_realms_cfg
tyraels_realms_crtr
Tyrales_realms_lnd
Tyrales_realms_media
Tyrales_realms.cfg

4.Move all 6 files into the following directory in your KeeperFX installation:
-KeeperFX/campgns

Launch KeeperFX and your campaign should now be available to play!
