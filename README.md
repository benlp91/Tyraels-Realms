🏰 KeeperFX Custom Campaign

This is a custom campaign for KeeperFX.
Please note: It requires the latest Alpha version of KeeperFX to run correctly.

📦 Installation Instructions

1.Click the green “Code” button at the top of this page.

2.Select “Download ZIP” and extract the contents to a temporary folder.

Unfortunately, GitHub places all files into an extra folder, which KeeperFX cannot read directly.

3.Open that folder and locate the following 6 files:

Tyrales_realms

Tyraels_realms_cfg

tyraels_realms_crtr

Tyrales_realms_lnd

Tyrales_realms_media

Tyrales_realms.cfg

4.Move all 6 files into the following directory in your KeeperFX installation:
-KeeperFX/campgns

Launch KeeperFX and your campaign should now be available to play!








FOR CHINESE PLAYERS ONLY:

Extract also the 7th File called Tyraels_realms_media_chi

Open the Tyraels_realms.cfg file and change the line "MEDIA_LOCATION = campgns/Tyraels_realms_media"      to     

"MEDIA_LOCATION = campgns/Tyraels_realms_media_chi"

and save the File.
